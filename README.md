# cn-chat
Simple client-server chat program written in Python.

# Instructions
The client and server modules must be ran in separate windows and requires
a current installation of Python 3. Non-windows environments may have to use
```python3 <file_name.py>``` to launch the python files

Window 1:

    python server.py

Window 2:

    python client.py

The client will start off by prompting for a message. Many messages can be added by typing and pressing ENTER
each time. Once "-1" is entered, all of the messages will be sent to the server and displayed.
